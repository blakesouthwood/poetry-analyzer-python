Gray white-edged clouds
blow through the sky,
seemingly swept along
by dancing switches
of white blossoms:
quaint hearth brooms made from
our ancient plum, its pale green lichen
crusting its soft-gray limbs.
I hold on to the tree,
cautious from tripping
on gopher excavations.
I watch you down the years
tending the yard:  mowing,
weeding, raking, pruning.
Now It smells of new blooms:
roses, nasturtiums,
honey locust, Scotch broom.
Bright-blue stellar jays caw
in the oak. A neighbor’s
black and white cat startles at their squawks,
then rolls around in your freshly-weeded
rose-garden dirt as if it were catnip.
You stretch as you stand up,
and smile, satisfied with
the piles of weeds destined
for the compost, “found”
earthworms to circulate air too.

Gray white-edged clouds
blow by,
switches
of white blossoms seeming to sweep them
along like quaint hearth brooms made from
ancient plum -- pale green lichen
crusting soft-gray limbs.
I hold on to you,
cautious from tripping.
Was the view always this clear?
Houses like white gift boxes
ribboned with waving greens,
rimmed on the far side by
slate-gray bay, camel hills and sky.
We stand on the edge
of the cliff every day.
I hang onto the plum’s rough trunk,
stare at the view...memorizing it with you.

CAT AND I

My cat and I
sat on the stairs
leading to the front porch
last night
in a golden arc of light.
A cricket chirped in the thicket
of English ivy and light blue-green juniper
tangled around the bright white railing.

My entranced, long-haired cat,
purred as he sat on a steep step.
With the rhythmic throbs
of the cricket’s sharp chirps
and my cat’s soothing purrs,
I was content.

I heard the bell
announce Noel -
a midnight bell -
Emanuel.

Like buoy bells,
marking channels,
stand sentinel
in salty swells,

my fears dispel
with their tinkles.

treebites = '''

A eucalyptus branch scared the
bejesus out of me on a sweaty summer day,
when it landed next to where I stood with a rush of
wind and its leaves rustling on dark soft earth.

This old thick tree has wind-peeled bark --
stiff curling strips that crunch underfoot.
Its lofty top sways fragrant
twilight-tinted leaves.
It hosts myriad hummingbirds,
an iridescent swirl of dazzling blues and greens.
They whiz around, up and down,
tasting tangerine geraniums and worrying my eyes
with their needle-sharp beaks and whirring thrums.

My son, topping the tree
among sighing leaves,
twice heard a living creature utter
“Unh-UNH-unh” after he drew a saw
through branches soft as butter.
He scrambled to the ground, a curious
look on his face.

His legs started itching
in three days.
The tree’s teeth
turned out to be at its base.
The tree’s teeth have a name.
It is POISON OAK.
My son scratched as he shouted,
“I’ll be ready for you next time!”

oldpath = '''

Like shade from white lace parasols,
below the overhanging trees
sunlight and shadow dance a reel.
Wind sways the leaf-green canopy.

The path we jogged on long ago
is still the one we stroll along,
while those new neighbors we don’t know
lope right on past us, being young.

When I’m at home and I recall
the fragrant bay and twisting oak,
I feel the aura mystical
that’s present in the woods we walk.

Spring 1997

A Seance?

A dozen of us, readers,
are gathered in a circle
of upholstered chairs
on an autumn night
while outside the wind rustles
eucalyptus leaves.
Lamps cast circles of light
in the redwood-paneled room.
We’re aficionados
of Sherlock Holmes,
his habits, his intelligence.
We discuss Dr. Bell,
role model for Holmes’s methods
and attention to detail.

I’m suddenly aware that
In the center of the circle,
by a redwood-burl coffee table,
there’s a powerful other presence:
Holmes is among us,
no doubt standing tall,
in tweeds and deerstalker,
brought to life by us all.
He exudes the aura
of nights on the moor,
and a howling hound,
of midnight knocks at 221B,
of cement-gray drifting fog
obscuring cobblestoned Baker Street,
of challenges from Moriarty,
and the impish Irene,
footprints in mud,
messages scrawled in blood.
And edifying chats with dear Dr. Watson.
