Gray white-edged clouds
blow through the sky,
seemingly swept along
by dancing switches
of white blossoms:
quaint hearth brooms made from
our ancient plum, its pale green lichen
crusting its soft-gray limbs.
I hold on to the tree,
cautious from tripping
on gopher excavations.
I watch you down the years
tending the yard:  mowing,
weeding, raking, pruning.
Now It smells of new blooms:
roses, nasturtiums,
honey locust, Scotch broom.
Bright-blue stellar jays caw
in the oak. A neighbor’s
black and white cat startles at their squawks,
then rolls around in your freshly-weeded
rose-garden dirt as if it were catnip.
You stretch as you stand up,
and smile, satisfied with
the piles of weeds destined
for the compost, “found”
earthworms to circulate air too.

Gray white-edged clouds
blow by,
switches
of white blossoms seeming to sweep them
along like quaint hearth brooms made from
ancient plum -- pale green lichen
crusting soft-gray limbs.
I hold on to you,
cautious from tripping.
Was the view always this clear?
Houses like white gift boxes
ribboned with waving greens,
rimmed on the far side by
slate-gray bay, camel hills and sky.
We stand on the edge
of the cliff every day.
I hang onto the plum’s rough trunk,
stare at the view...memorizing it with you.

catpoem = '''
CAT AND I

My cat and I
sat on the stairs
leading to the front porch
last night
in a golden arc of light.
A cricket chirped in the thicket
of English ivy and light blue-green juniper
tangled around the bright white railing.

My entranced, long-haired cat,
purred as he sat on a steep step.
With the rhythmic throbs
of the cricket’s sharp chirps
and my cat’s soothing purrs,
I was content.

december = '''

I heard the bell
announce Noel -
a midnight bell -
Emanuel.

Like buoy bells,
marking channels,
stand sentinel
in salty swells,

my fears dispel
with their tinkles.

'''





treebites = '''

A eucalyptus branch scared the
bejesus out of me on a sweaty summer day,
when it landed next to where I stood with a rush of
wind and its leaves rustling on dark soft earth.

This old thick tree has wind-peeled bark --
stiff curling strips that crunch underfoot.
Its lofty top sways fragrant
twilight-tinted leaves.
It hosts myriad hummingbirds,
an iridescent swirl of dazzling blues and greens.
They whiz around, up and down,
tasting tangerine geraniums and worrying my eyes
with their needle-sharp beaks and whirring thrums.

My son, topping the tree
among sighing leaves,
twice heard a living creature utter
“Unh-UNH-unh” after he drew a saw
through branches soft as butter.
He scrambled to the ground, a curious
look on his face.

His legs started itching
in three days.
The tree’s teeth
turned out to be at its base.
The tree’s teeth have a name.
It is POISON OAK.
My son scratched as he shouted,
“I’ll be ready for you next time!”

'''








oldpath = '''

Like shade from white lace parasols,
below the overhanging trees
sunlight and shadow dance a reel.
Wind sways the leaf-green canopy.

The path we jogged on long ago
is still the one we stroll along,
while those new neighbors we don’t know
lope right on past us, being young.

When I’m at home and I recall
the fragrant bay and twisting oak,
I feel the aura mystical
that’s present in the woods we walk.

holmesappears = '''

Spring 1997

A Seance?

A dozen of us, readers,
are gathered in a circle
of upholstered chairs
on an autumn night
while outside the wind rustles
eucalyptus leaves.
Lamps cast circles of light
in the redwood-paneled room.
We’re aficionados
of Sherlock Holmes,
his habits, his intelligence.
We discuss Dr. Bell,
role model for Holmes’s methods
and attention to detail.

I’m suddenly aware that
In the center of the circle,
by a redwood-burl coffee table,
there’s a powerful other presence:
Holmes is among us,
no doubt standing tall,
in tweeds and deerstalker,
brought to life by us all.
He exudes the aura
of nights on the moor,
and a howling hound,
of midnight knocks at 221B,
of cement-gray drifting fog
obscuring cobblestoned Baker Street,
of challenges from Moriarty,
and the impish Irene,
footprints in mud,
messages scrawled in blood.
And edifying chats with dear Dr. Watson.
'''




nature_tankas = '''

Is April hiding?
A cold wind blows from the north.
In spite of the chill,
the old honey locust is
crowned with a lettuce-green mist.

Water thrusts this way,
a luge of hot Pacific
current, El Nino,
bringing us mudslides, chilly
houses, snow-white Coleman light.
A possum runs in
the ditch by the road as I
jog.  I hear rustling
leaves.  Later, he peeps through our
window as we watch TV.

bellyflower_tanka_trio = '''
Bellyflower Tanka Trio
Crickets look down at
bellyflowers, daphne-pink
or daffodil-gold.
In sun-drenched fields, shady lawns,
the puddles of color show.

 For bellyflowers
to be seen, it’s said around
here, you must be prone.
If you’re alone, prone, looking,
you might elicit looks too.

 I use a thimble
when I place bellyflowers
in a vase.  Bonsai
trees with some planted in moss -
like spring in the Sierras.


When I was swimming
in the ocean one day near
Pollock Rip, a fish
swam by and then a big ship.

painting = '''

I dreamed of a house by the sea,
a house full of love where
happiness flowed
like the tide,
where salt wind blew
singing mermaid songs
through beach grass, bayberry,
and porch screens.
Where we’d race
across damp sand
and splash into the cold sea
in dazzling Cape sun,
then wrapped in white kimonos
sit on the porch of our house on a hill
overlooking the waves,
eat bacon and raspberries,
sip coffee,
which appeared magically,
though we had complete privacy.
Where we’d read mysteries.
Where wild roses grew in the yard
and I made rose hip jelly.
Where we would always be together,
fresh as the first of May,
and happy.

Our grandfather clock ticks
the time away.  It’s chimes
have marked off many days,
both good and hard to bear,
since I dreamed
early dreams.
Our house on a hill
overlooks the Bay
of another sea.
Our wild roses are white and
need to be sprayed
so the hips can’t be used for jelly.
Our pink roses are behind chicken
wire to protect them
from hungry deer.


You don’t like kimonos,
would rather wear denim.
I slather sun block.

We eat tofu, not bacon,
because of the salt.
and we peek at TV
while we read
mysteries.
The part of the dream
that came completely true
was that I’m happy
growing old
with you.


When I walk in early
morning fresh air, you are
with me, holding
my lucky hand
that holds the hand
of a decent man.


When the fog blew in,
the fog horns blew,
and we had a fire in
the franklin stove
and curled up cozily,
while drinking tea,
in Irish sweaters
and jeans.
We’ve seen scams, and fakes,
and greed personified,
exhibiting
the corrupt side of humanity.

'''





snowballs = '''

40,000 snowballs a day invade our atmosphere.
Half as big as the Taj-Mahal dome, they melt in our air.

Snowflakes star our eyelashes, ornament our hair with white.
Windshield wipers on an arriving bus scrape snow away.

You touch my hand unexpectedly. I burn and I melt,
like plummeting snowballs showering the world all around.

Snow sprinkles the robe of the Virgin in the fenced churchyard.
I board the damp-smelling bus, watch you through the back window.

The Virgin, covered with white, looks like a bride in the night.
Chimes from the old church fill the air, as the snowballs fill seas.

Do the colors of fish depend on nutrients from space?
Do tidbits of Milky Way make sand-dabs silver and white?

Back to your lamp-lit office, out of the cold snow you sprint.
My second-sight tells me we will be wedded in this church.

'''


halloween = '''

The children are a dinosaur, empress,
S. Holmes, Consulting Detective, headless
horseman.  Pillow cases at the ready.
We’ve eaten treats, bought new already,
set up CD’s to play horrible groans,
put the cat where it won’t hear the weird moans.
One parent going with the kids, the other
staying home to answer the door, they’d rather
both troop with the laughing kids through the night
no matter how old they stll love the sight
of the dark cool wind-rushing dark, the lights
on the houses where all the folks delight
in the bright-eyed little ones who look so sweet
whether dressed as a princess or in a sheet
and who can’t believe it is really true
that once costumed all you have to do
is knock on a door and call “Trick or Treat”
and you will be given candy to eat.
Once home they dump their sacks on the floor
compare what they got, trade, see who got more.
One by one they drift off to bed, leaving
their two parents who can’t resist thieving.

Young blood now gone to bed,
house fills up with the dead.
Ghosts seem to float
on the front door, the mantelpiece,
proclaiming restless
graves, evil done,  like Hamlet’s looming father.
A skeleton’s hand
protruding from a white silken sleeve
sneaks over the top of a carved willow chest,
pulls in vain at its heavy rim.
An old ceramic pumpkin,
crackly as an ancient bowl,
has a grin as snaggly-toothed as Yorick’s.
The evil-eyed witch is where she belongs,
the cupboard empty of Snickers.
The parents are with “pleasure filled”.
The children sleep.
The ghosts creep
back to their graves.
'''


shaky = '''

Alive, in a manner of speaking,
wanting to escape into death
where would float around,
not be petrifed flesh,
unable to fish in a pocket for keys

for a wallet, or kleenex.
Fingers that once chased
Bach fugues around
piano keys and
gentled
babies,
now trembling
shaking like a drunk,
arousing suspicion.
Shuffling, bent,
with stiff faces,
words unheard, quavering,
choking on food,
gasping for death.

honeylocustspring = '''

April 1997

At the start of spring every year,
like a miracle, overnight
honey locust blossoms appear,
twin to wisteria, but white.

Their sweet scent wafts through my bedroom
window, graceful white caps on a
sea of green leaves.  The flower-bloom
makes of the tree a big bouquet.

The newborn leaves, a soft, spring green
in the purity of morning
light, have a luminescent sheen.
The breeze sends them to-and-fro-ing.

Bees form a cloud over the blooms.
The tree’s electric with their hum.
Birds converse and trill as they zoom
about, to twigs and branches come.

Once in a while during the day
I step outside to stand below
the tree, breathe deep, watch flowers sway.
I’m high, my delight overflows.

einstein = '''

 The Sadness of No Proximity

If Einstein had been born near me instead
I can’t help but wonder what he’d have said
Re the cucumber vine, which does displace
Far more than its namesake:  nine feet of space,
Bears a flimsy, quickly shriveling flower,
With E=mc2 of an hour.


He might have have complained that gophers don’t eat
Cucumber vine like a vegetable treat.
It grows on fences, it winds around trees,
And soon dies, leaving tangled vines and leaves.
Maybe he would say what I will now say:
I wish cucumber vines would go away.

pleasestayhome = '''

I’m staying home today.  Won’t you?
I’ve been a working robot
for so long.  I want to drink my coffee,
eat hot croissants with jam,
with you, leisurely....before the holidays
usurp autumn, turn it into Hallowe’en,
Thanksgiving, Christmas shopping.
Our house, pleasant as a B&B,
calls to me, this time of year,
to stay right here.
When we got up today, I knew
I couldn’t bear to leave.
I heard the wistful
coos of doves, saw hummingbirds
drink water from a sprinkler,
dark pewter clouds
blow in from the west,
cover sunlit streaks
of silver sky,
a hint of mist.

We need a day to sit,
not spend in drudgery,
to see the beauty of the fading year
before it disappears.
Look at the blue-green
eucalyptus leaves undulating, rustling
in the breeze
pouring through the canyon.
Their pungent fragrance clothes
the tired summer dust.
Firethorn heavy with berries licks
the patio wall,
French lavender’s in rampant flower,
buckeye nuts -
glossy, dark-chocolate -
hang in pistachio-green pods.

This is all I’m going to do today:
put eucalyptus
in this Wedgwood-blue bowl

on your Grandmother’s
white crocheted tablecloth,
to look at while we drink coffee.

Take a deep breath.
How the eucalyptus
sparks the air!

newyearsevekiss= '''

Nobody knows it’s ‘97
on this whirling world, up in heaven,
it’s only on this earth the New Year
is a big deal, you have to be here.
In heaven, they’ve arrived, they are there,
about the New Year they do not care.
Heaven’s surely our paradigm.
We all hope to be let in sometime.
Time is endless, also brief, timeless.
But we are aware, and try to compress
rapidly speeding time which goes faster,
wear watches to avoid disaster,
like not sharing a kiss on the chime
of midnight, drinking a toast old-time.
While they float about in heavenly bliss,
down here on earth, we toast and we kiss,
with evident joy proclaim a New Year.
Actually, I’m glad to still be here,
though the folks in heaven, it is clear,
share in the bliss of a kiss all year.
