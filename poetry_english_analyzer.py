# the idea for this project stemmed from a request from
# my mother a poet that wanted to check if she had used a phrase in her poems
# collection previously. I decided to recreate the Poetry Database in Python
# along with it's unique search characteristics.

# Analyzing English focusing on poetry first
# I decided to analyze hundreds of poems to master everything
# with strings and analysis of English
# I'm starting by analyzing 3 poems before searching through hundreds


# Searches for substring phrase in multiple longstrings
# this searches for whether or not a phrase(substring) exists in a poem(big string)
# loop to search through each value in the dictionary based on the key


'''

 count_word_match()        counts the number of times a word is used in one large string

 search_for_phrase()       searches through dictionary for a phrase in lots of large strings
 
 get_substring_location()  returns the location of first character of substring in string

'''
 Count number of times a word is used in a poem(big string)
 inputs are the poem(big string), and substring
 using a chain the methods lower() and count() are called
 this searches for a substring within a large string

 This function is designed to count in one string at a time
 and could easily be incorporated into a loop to be used in the dictionary
