# the idea for this project stemmed from a request from
# my mother a poet that wanted to check if she had used a phrase in her poems
# collection previously. I decided to recreate the Poetry Database in Python
# along with it's unique search characteristics.

# Analyzing English focusing on poetry first
# I decided to analyze hundreds of poems to master everything
# with strings and analysis of English
# I'm starting by analyzing 3 poems before searching through hundreds


# list of poems will go there ... testing with three to start with
# this is an example DICTIONARY with keys and values, the values are actually large strings


# Searches for substring phrase in multiple longstrings
# this searches for whether or not a phrase(substring) exists in a poem(big string)
# loop to search through each value in
# the dictionary based on the key


'''
The two functions are beneath the poems.

 count_word_match()   counts the number of times a word is used in one large string
 
 search_for_phrase()  searches through dictionary for a phrase in lots of large strings

Gray white-edged clouds
blow through the sky,
seemingly swept along
by dancing switches
of white blossoms:
quaint hearth brooms made from
our ancient plum, its pale green lichen
crusting its soft-gray limbs.
I hold on to the tree,
cautious from tripping
on gopher excavations.
I watch you down the years
tending the yard:  mowing,
weeding, raking, pruning.
Now It smells of new blooms:
roses, nasturtiums,
honey locust, Scotch broom.
Bright-blue stellar jays caw
in the oak. A neighbor’s
black and white cat startles at their squawks,
then rolls around in your freshly-weeded
rose-garden dirt as if it were catnip.
You stretch as you stand up,
and smile, satisfied with
the piles of weeds destined
for the compost, “found”
earthworms to circulate air too.

Gray white-edged clouds
blow by,
switches
of white blossoms seeming to sweep them
along like quaint hearth brooms made from
ancient plum -- pale green lichen
crusting soft-gray limbs.
I hold on to you,
cautious from tripping.
Was the view always this clear?
Houses like white gift boxes
ribboned with waving greens,
rimmed on the far side by
slate-gray bay, camel hills and sky.
We stand on the edge
of the cliff every day.
I hang onto the plum’s rough trunk,
stare at the view...memorizing it with you.

CAT AND I

My cat and I
sat on the stairs
leading to the front porch
last night
in a golden arc of light.
A cricket chirped in the thicket
of English ivy and light blue-green juniper
tangled around the bright white railing.

My entranced, long-haired cat,
purred as he sat on a steep step.
With the rhythmic throbs 
of the cricket’s sharp chirps
and my cat’s soothing purrs,
I was content.
